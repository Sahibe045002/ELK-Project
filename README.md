## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze automotive industry data to identify trends in **selling price**, **vehicle models**, **state-wise demand**, and **car conditions**. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for **business decision-making** in pricing, inventory management, and understanding demand across various car makes and states.


## Graph 1: **"Selling price VS MMR"** 
**Question:**
- How does the median selling price compare with MMR (Manheim Market Report values) across various car models?

**Analysis:**
- This scatterplot shows the relationship between the median selling price and MMR.
- The data points are clustered primarily in lower MMR ranges.
- There is a wide variance in selling prices despite MMR values staying on the lower side.

**Insight:**
- Vehicles with low-to-mid MMR values still have considerable selling price deviations.
- Only one data point lies near 9M MMR, and its corresponding selling price is quite low.

## Graph 2: **"State wise avg selling price"**
**Question:**
- Which states show the highest and lowest average selling prices for car makes, and what patterns can be observed?

**Analysis:**
- States `mi`, `nv`, and `Other` show different price ranges.
- The "Other" category in the state section has higher prices, depicted in red, indicating values **above 127 million**.
- Manufacturers such as **Jaguar, Land Rover, and Lexus** contribute largely to these high values.

**Insight:**
- States like Michigan (mi) and Nevada (nv) exhibit significant price fluctuations.
- Focus on the **Other** category suggests key outliers.

## Graph 3: **"Model VS Price"**
**Question:**
- How do vehicle models vary in median selling price, and which models dominate premium pricing?

**Analysis:**
- **Rolls-Royce** and **Ferrari** command the highest median selling prices, exceeding 150,000.
- Tesla shows a moderate price range, while brands like **Bentley** and **Aston Martin** have lower medians compared to Rolls-Royce.

**Insight:**
- Luxury and premium brands dominate higher price segments, validating strong demand for high-value vehicles.

## Graph 4: **"MMR VS Body"**
**Question:**
- How do vehicle body types correlate with MMR values, and which are the most popular categories?

**Analysis:**
- **Sedans** dominate MMR counts with nearly 50,000 occurrences, followed by **SUVs**.
- Coupes, Hatchbacks, and Minivans show much lower MMR counts in comparison.

**Insight:**
- Sedans and SUVs are the most frequent car bodies, reinforcing their widespread popularity in the market.
- Inventory strategies could prioritize Sedans and SUVs.

## Graph 5: **"Color VS State"**
**Question:**
- How does the distribution of vehicle colors vary across states?

**Analysis:**
- The chart shows colors like **white, gray, and silver** are dominant, accounting for over 10% each.
- Black, green, red, and blue follow closely, with slight variations across states.

**Insight:**
- Neutral colors (white, gray, silver) dominate preferences across regions.
- Target inventory based on popular car colors.

**Question:**
- What is the distribution of vehicle makes based on their condition?

**Analysis:**
- Brands like **Ferrari (19.05%)**, **Bentley (16.64%)**, and **Aston Martin (18.4%)** dominate vehicle conditions.
- Lower-condition vehicles are distributed under the "Other" section (12.9%).

**Insight:**
- Premium car brands have a higher share in good condition vehicles.
- Vehicle maintenance strategies should cater to Ferrari, Bentley, and Aston Martin.

## Graph 8: **"Distribution by Vehicle Make"**
**Question:**
- What is the overall distribution of vehicle makes?

**Analysis:**
- The "Other" category dominates at **71.7%**, meaning many car brands have negligible market share.
- Ford (10.19%) and Chevrolet (7.14%) lead significant portions of the market.
